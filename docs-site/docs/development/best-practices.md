# Best Practices

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use ES6+ features for JavaScript
- Follow BEM naming convention for CSS classes
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

## Git Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

````

2. Make your changes and commit them:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: description of your changes"
   ```

3. Push your changes:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Create a pull request

## Security Best Practices

- Never store sensitive data in code
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use HttpOnly cookies for authentication tokens
- Follow Django security practices
- Use HTTPS in production

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize database queries
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Minimize DOM manipulations
- Use efficient CSS selectors
- Optimize images and assets

## Documentation

- Document all new features
- Update existing documentation when making changes
- Add docstrings to Python functions and classes
- Add comments to complex JavaScript functions

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### Backend Issues

- **Database migrations failing**:

  - Check for circular dependencies in models
  - Make sure your models are properly defined
  - Try `make migrate --fake` to skip problematic migrations

- **API endpoints not working**:
  - Check URL configuration in `urls.py`
  - Verify serializer fields
  - Check permissions

### Frontend Issues

- **Page not rendering**:

  - Check browser console for errors
  - Verify that the template path is correct
  - Check that the page is registered with the router

- **API requests failing**:
  - Check network tab in browser dev tools
  - Verify that you're sending the correct data
  - Check authentication status

### Docker Issues

- **Container not starting**:
  - Check Docker logs: `docker logs ft_transcendence_django`
  - Verify environment variables in `.env` file
  - Check port conflicts

## Getting Help

If you're stuck, you can:

- Check the project documentation
- Look at similar implementations in the codebase
- Ask for help from other team members
